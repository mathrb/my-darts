# Darts App

A **local-first**, open-source darts application for Android and iOS, built with Flutter. Users can track statistics, play manually, or optionally use a self-hosted backend for auto-scoring via computer vision.

## Features
- **Local-First**: Works offline by default, with optional backend sync.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Save and view game statistics locally.
- **Auto-Scoring (Optional)**: Use a self-hosted backend to detect darts via computer vision.
- **Cross-Platform**: Targets Android and iOS; Flutter Web is supported as a development/debug target.

## Advanced Features

For advanced functionality including remote multiplayer, authentication, and complex synchronization, see [Backend Integration](docs/BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md).

### Multiplayer Support
This application supports both local (hotseat) and remote multiplayer modes. Detailed architecture and implementation guidance is available in the backend integration documentation.

## Documentation

For detailed technical information, see:
- [Data Structure](docs/DATA.md) - Database schema and data models
- [System Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Technical architecture and design

## Architecture
### Frontend (Flutter)
- **Local Storage**: Uses SQLite (via sqflite package) to store statistics offline on mobile. SQLite was chosen for its relational capabilities, complex query support, and better long-term maintainability for statistics tracking. On web, a compatible alternative (e.g. `drift` with IndexedDB) is used via repository abstraction.
- **UI**: Built with Flutter widgets for a native-like experience.
- **Optional Backend Sync**: Connects to a self-hosted backend if configured.

### Backend (Optional, Self-Hosted)
- **REST API**: For syncing statistics and auto-scoring.
- **Computer Vision**: Detects darts using PyTorch or ONNX models (Rust/Python).
- **Self-Hosted**: Users can run their own backend (Python or Rust).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (with web support enabled for headless development).
- Python or Rust (for backend, if used).
- Optional: LibTorch or ONNX runtime (for computer vision).

### Running on Web (Headless / Development)

Flutter Web is the recommended way to iterate quickly in a headless environment without a connected device. Game logic, UI, and backend API calls all behave identically to the mobile target. Native-only features (camera, SQLite) are stubbed on web.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darts-app.git
   cd darts-app
   ```
2. Install Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Enable Flutter Web if not already active:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```
4. Run in Chrome (requires a display) or build and serve for remote access:
   ```bash
   # Option A — run directly in Chrome
   flutter run -d chrome

   # Option B — build and serve over the network (headless-friendly)
   flutter build web
   cd build/web && python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Then open http://<your-machine-ip>:8080 in any browser
   ```

> **Note**: `sqflite` is not supported on web. When running the web build, the data layer falls back to a browser-compatible storage backend. Data entered in the web build does not persist to the mobile SQLite database.

### Install on Mobile (Android / iOS)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darts-app.git
   cd darts-app
   ```
2. Install Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Add SQLite dependency (if not already in pubspec.yaml):
   ```bash
   flutter pub add sqflite
   flutter pub add path_provider
   ```
4. Connect a physical device or start an emulator, then run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Set Up the Backend (Optional)
#### Python Backend
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask opencv-python torch
   ```
2. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```
3. Configure the app to use the backend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

#### Rust Backend
1. Install Rust:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `tract-onnx` or `tch-rs`):
   ```bash
   cargo add tract-onnx
   ```
