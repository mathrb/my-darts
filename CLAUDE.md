## Project Overview

A local-first, open-source darts scoring app for Android and iOS built with Flutter. Supports X01, Cricket, Around the Clock, Bob's 27, Catch 40, Shanghai, and Checkout Practice. Players can track statistics across all game types.

**Flutter Web is the development/debug target.** Run `flutter run -d chrome`. All game logic and UI behaves identically to mobile; native-only features (camera, SQLite) are abstracted via the Drift factory.

---

## Running the Project

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # after any @freezed or @riverpod change
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8087 --web-hostname 0.0.0.0  # headless/remote server
flutter test
flutter test -r failures-only  # errors only
flutter analyze                 # static analysis
```

**Mobile debugging:** No USB connection available. APK is built via GitHub Actions CI. To debug mobile-only issues, surface errors in the UI (e.g. timeouts with step labels) rather than relying on `flutter logs` or console output.

### Web — one-time asset setup (required before first `flutter run`)

```bash
# 1. Compile the Drift web worker (only needed when drift version changes)
dart compile js -O4 -o web/drift_worker.dart.js web/drift_worker.dart

# 2. Download sqlite3.wasm matching pubspec.lock version
grep -A7 "^  sqlite3:$" pubspec.lock | grep version   # check version
curl -L -o web/sqlite3.wasm \
  "https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/releases/download/sqlite3-v<VERSION>/sqlite3.wasm"
```

Missing either file causes a silent 404 that breaks the database provider. See `docs/BUILD.md` for full troubleshooting.

## Architecture Constraints

These are hard constraints. Breaking them requires explicit human approval.

### 1. Feature-First Clean Architecture

```
lib/features/<feature>/
  domain/       ← pure Dart only — NO Flutter, NO drift, NO http
  data/         ← implements domain interfaces; contains drift/sqflite code
  presentation/ ← Flutter widgets and Riverpod providers
```

- `domain/` has zero imports of `package:flutter`, `package:drift`, `package:sqflite`, or `package:dio`.
- No feature imports another feature directly. Cross-feature communication via `core/` providers or shared domain entities only.
- `core/` contains no domain logic — only infrastructure (database wiring, error types, shared utilities).

### 2. Dependency Direction

```
UI widgets → Riverpod Notifiers → Use Cases → Repository Interfaces ← Repository Implementations
```

No widget reads a repository directly. No use case touches Flutter.

### 3. Games Are Event Streams

Every change to game state must be expressed as a `GameEvent` appended to `game_events`. See `docs/GAME-EVENT-SPECIFICATIONS.md`.

> **If it changes the game, it must be an event. No exceptions.**

### 4. Statistics Are Projections — Never Stored

Statistics are computed by replaying `game_events`. Never write code that stores a computed average, checkout percentage, or win rate in the database.

### 5. Immutable State

All state classes use `freezed`. Never mutate state in place. Always use `copyWith`.

---

## Technology Decisions

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| State management | Riverpod with code generation (`@riverpod`, `riverpod_generator`) |
| Immutable state / entities | `freezed` |
| Cross-platform database | `drift` with Drift factory pattern (`lib/core/persistence/drift/`) |
| HTTP client (backend, optional) | `dio` |
| Secure token storage | `flutter_secure_storage` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| UUID generation | `uuid` |
| Code generation runner | `build_runner` |
| Crash reporting | `sentry_flutter` (initialized in `lib/main.dart`; do not remove `SentryFlutter.init`) |

Platform selection (native SQLite vs WASM) happens once in the Drift factory. Everywhere else sees only the repository interface.

---

## Riverpod Conventions

Follow `docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` exactly. Rules that are easiest to violate:
- Provider names strip the `Notifier` suffix: `FooNotifier` → `fooProvider`; family variant `FooNotifier.build(String id)` → `fooProvider('id')`.
- Use `ref.watch()` inside `build()`. Use `ref.read()` only in event handlers and notifier methods.
- Handle all three `AsyncValue` states in every widget: `data`, `loading`, `error`. Never use `.value!` without fallbacks.
- Use `AsyncValue.value` (returns `T?`) — not `valueOrNull` — in Riverpod 3.x.

---

## File Conventions

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| New use case | `lib/features/<feature>/domain/usecases/<name>_use_case.dart` |
| New provider | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/providers/<name>_provider.dart` |
| New state class | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/state/<name>_state.dart` (always `@freezed`) |
| New screen | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/pages/<name>_page.dart` |
| New widget | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/widgets/<name>_widget.dart` |
| New repository impl | `lib/features/<feature>/data/repositories/<name>_repository_impl.dart` |

State classes always include `factory <ClassName>.initial()`. Screens are `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget`. Pure UI widgets with no providers are `StatelessWidget`.

---

## Segment Format Convention

Used in `dart_throws.segment`, `DartThrown` event payloads, and all engine logic. Never deviate.

| Hit | String |
|---|---|
| Single 20 | `'20'` |
| Double 20 | `'D20'` |
| Triple 20 | `'T20'` |
| Single bull | `'SB'` |
| Double bull | `'DB'` |
| Miss | `'MISS'` |

---

## Key Rules

**GameConfig dispatch:** Use `maybeMap` (not `maybeWhen`) — callbacks receive typed subclass instances: `config.maybeMap(x01: (c) => c.startingScore, orElse: () => '')`. Requires explicit `import 'game_config.dart'`; not available via transitive import.

**Repository exceptions:** All exceptions extend `RepositoryException` (`lib/core/error/repository_exception.dart`). Never throw raw `Exception` from a repository implementation.

**Contract tests:** Every repository implementation must pass the shared contract tests in `test/contracts/`. Never skip or comment out tests to make CI pass.

**Database:** `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` must be set in `onOpen` (sqflite) / `beforeOpen` (drift). Schema is currently single-version (`databaseVersion = 1`); future schema migrations will be applied in `onUpgrade` (sqflite) / `MigrationStrategy.onUpgrade` (drift). Completed games are read-only — enforced in application logic, not triggers.

**Test game setup ordering:** Drift enforces read-only on completed games. In tests: create game with `isComplete: false` → insert darts/events → call `gameRepo.completeGame()`. Never set `isComplete: true` at creation if you need to insert data afterward.

**Statistics scope resets:** Turn resets on `TurnStarted`, Leg resets on `LegCompleted`, Match resets on `GameCompleted`. No other reset points.

**DartThrown payload keys:** `competitor_id`, `player_id`, `segment`, `multiplier`, `score`, `input_method` only (see `buildDartThrownEvent` in `lib/features/game/domain/usecases/game_use_case_helpers.dart`). No `turn_number`, no `dart_number` — reconstruct turn grouping via `TurnStarted`/`TurnEnded` event boundaries if needed.

**Computing stats over an event slice:** Build a `ProjectionRunner` with the projections you need, call `init(ProjectionContext(...))` then `run(events)` then `snapshot()`. Snapshot keys: `x01_average`, `x01_checkout`, `x01_highest_checkout`, `x01.highScoreBuckets`, `cricket.mpt`, `cricket.markBuckets`, `cricket.firstNineMpr`. Same wiring lives in both statistics repos and `ComputeLegStatsUseCase` — update all three when it changes.

**Dual statistics repositories:** Statistics queries exist in both `lib/features/statistics/data/repositories/statistics_repository_impl.dart` (sqflite) and `lib/core/persistence/drift/repositories/statistics_repository_drift.dart` (drift). Always update both when changing query logic.

**Statistics scope is required:** `getPlayerStats` and `watchPlayerStats` take `required GameType gameType`. PPR-shaped fields are X01-only and cricket fields are cricket-only — a single call cannot mix types coherently. The player-picker AVG badge consumes `playerStatsProvider`, which passes `GameType.x01`.

**Notifier tests:** Use `ProviderContainer` with `overrides`. Never instantiate notifiers directly. Use `ProviderScope` with `overrides` for widget tests.

**Widget test finders:** `StatFormatter.fmtDouble` strips trailing zeros — e.g. `170.0` → `'170'`, which collides with raw `int` values rendered the same way. Prefer `findsNWidgets(n)` or more specific finders (`find.descendant`) over `findsOneWidget` when stat rows may share literals.

**Colors:** Always use themed color tokens from `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Never hardcode color values directly in widgets.

**Number formatting:** Use `StatFormatter` (`lib/core/utils/stat_formatter.dart`) for all statistics display — `fmtDouble`, `fmtPct`, `fmtPerLeg`. Never use inline `toStringAsFixed()` in statistics UI.

**Round semantics:** A "round" is one full rotation where ALL competitors throw. `totalRounds` is the correct field name. Do not use `maxRounds` or count per-competitor turns or individual dart throws as rounds.

**Per-leg round cap:** X01 and Cricket enforce a round cap per leg (see `GameConfigurationConstants` and engine logic). When the cap is hit with no winner, the leg is decided by current standing — do not extend rounds silently. Both engines and any UI showing round progress must respect this.

**Spec edits:** When asked to update a spec or document, only edit that document — do not modify code files unless explicitly asked.

**UI refactors:** After any widget redesign or UI refactor, update the corresponding test expectations in the same session before committing.

## Things You Must Not Do

- Store statistics (averages, ratios, percentages) as pre-calculated values in the database
- Import `drift`, `sqflite`, `flutter`, or `dio` in any `domain/` layer file
- Import one feature's code from another feature's folder
- Call `ref.read()` inside a widget's `build()` method
- Catch exceptions inside `AsyncValue.guard()`
- Use `!` on `AsyncValue.value` in user-facing UI without loading and error handling
- Mutate `GameState` in place — always `copyWith`
- Skip or comment out contract tests to make CI pass
- Add database triggers — immutability of completed games is application logic only
- Add packages without checking whether the existing stack already covers the need
- Run `flutter create --platforms=android .` locally — Android platform is scaffolded in CI only
- Build an Android APK without first scaffolding the platform: `android/` is not in the repo — run `flutter create --platforms=android .` before `flutter build apk`

## When Uncertain

1. **Check the spec docs first.** Most questions are answered in `docs/`.
2. **Check the game rules.** `docs/games/` has formal transition tables.
3. **Do not invent architecture.** If a pattern isn't in `docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` or `docs/ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md`, raise it before implementing.
4. **Do not change repository interface signatures** unilaterally — they are shared contracts.
5. **Raise ambiguities explicitly.** If a transition table doesn't cover a case, say so.
