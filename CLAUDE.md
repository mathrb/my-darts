## Project Overview

A local-first, open-source darts scoring app for Android and iOS built with Flutter. Supports X01, Cricket, Around the Clock, Bob's 27, Catch 40, Shanghai, and Checkout Practice. Players can track statistics across all game types.

**Flutter Web is the development/debug target.** Run `flutter run -d chrome`. All game logic and UI behaves identically to mobile; native-only features (camera, SQLite) are abstracted via the Drift factory.

---

## Running the Project

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # after any @freezed or @riverpod change
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8087 --web-hostname 0.0.0.0  # headless/remote server
flutter test
flutter test -r failures-only  # errors only
flutter analyze                 # static analysis
```

**Mobile debugging:** No USB connection available. APKs can be built locally (see "Building Android APKs" below) or via GitHub Actions CI. To debug mobile-only issues, surface errors in the UI (e.g. timeouts with step labels) rather than relying on `flutter logs` or console output.

### Building Android APKs

`android/` is gitignored. Each dev scaffolds it once per machine:

```bash
flutter create --platforms=android --org app .   # one-time, after fresh clone or rm -rf android/
bash tools/post-create-android.sh                 # override applicationId to app.dartlodge
flutter build apk --debug                         # or --release
```

Requires JDK 17 + Android SDK on `PATH` (`JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`). Non-interactive shells (incl. Bash tool calls) don't load `~/.bashrc` — use `tools/release-debug.sh` or prepend env exports inline. CI also produces release APKs.

**Sideloading to a phone:** `tools/release-debug.sh` bumps `versionCode`, rebuilds, and copies the APK to `releases/dartlodge-debug-<version>.apk` (folder gitignored). Serve `releases/` by whichever method (Python http.server, nginx, docker — devs choose). In-place upgrades require both an increased `versionCode` AND a matching signing key; debug builds on the same machine share `~/.android/debug.keystore` so upgrades just work; mixing local debug ↔ CI release ↔ another machine forces uninstall. Android identifies apps by `applicationId` + signing key, NOT by APK filename — different filenames with the same identity all upgrade the same installed app.

### Web — one-time asset setup (required before first `flutter run`)

```bash
# 1. Compile the Drift web worker (only needed when drift version changes)
dart compile js -O4 -o web/drift_worker.dart.js web/drift_worker.dart

# 2. Download sqlite3.wasm matching pubspec.lock version
grep -A7 "^  sqlite3:$" pubspec.lock | grep version   # check version
curl -L -o web/sqlite3.wasm \
  "https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/releases/download/sqlite3-v<VERSION>/sqlite3.wasm"
```

Missing either file causes a silent 404 that breaks the database provider. See `docs/BUILD.md` for full troubleshooting.

---

## Architecture Constraints

These are hard constraints. Breaking them requires explicit human approval.

### 1. Feature-First Clean Architecture

```
lib/features/<feature>/
  domain/       ← pure Dart only — NO Flutter, NO drift, NO http
  data/         ← implements domain interfaces; contains drift/sqflite code
  presentation/ ← Flutter widgets and Riverpod providers
```

- `domain/` has zero imports of `package:flutter`, `package:drift`, `package:sqflite`, or `package:dio`.
- No feature imports another feature directly. Cross-feature communication via `core/` providers or shared domain entities only.
- `core/` contains no domain logic — only infrastructure (database wiring, error types, shared utilities).

### 2. Dependency Direction

```
UI widgets → Riverpod Notifiers → Use Cases → Repository Interfaces ← Repository Implementations
```

No widget reads a repository directly. No use case touches Flutter.

### 3. Games Are Event Streams

Every change to game state must be expressed as a `GameEvent` appended to `game_events`. See `docs/GAME-EVENT-SPECIFICATIONS.md`.

> **If it changes the game, it must be an event. No exceptions.**

### 4. Statistics Are Projections — Never Stored

Statistics are computed by replaying `game_events`. Never write code that stores a computed average, checkout percentage, or win rate in the database.

### 5. Immutable State

All state classes use `freezed`. Never mutate state in place. Always use `copyWith`.

---

## Technology Decisions

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| State management | Riverpod with code generation (`@riverpod`, `riverpod_generator`) |
| Immutable state / entities | `freezed` |
| Cross-platform database | `drift` with Drift factory pattern (`lib/core/persistence/drift/`) |
| HTTP client (backend, optional) | `dio` |
| Secure token storage | `flutter_secure_storage` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| UUID generation | `uuid` |
| Code generation runner | `build_runner` |
| Crash reporting | `sentry_flutter` (initialized in `lib/main.dart`; do not remove `SentryFlutter.init`) |

Platform selection (native SQLite vs WASM) happens once in the Drift factory. Everywhere else sees only the repository interface.

---

## Riverpod Conventions

Follow `docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` exactly. Rules that are easiest to violate:
- Provider names strip the `Notifier` suffix: `FooNotifier` → `fooProvider`; family variant `FooNotifier.build(String id)` → `fooProvider('id')`.
- Use `ref.watch()` inside `build()`. Use `ref.read()` only in event handlers and notifier methods.
- Handle all three `AsyncValue` states in every widget: `data`, `loading`, `error`. Never use `.value!` without fallbacks.
- Use `AsyncValue.value` (returns `T?`) — not `valueOrNull` — in Riverpod 3.x.

---

## File Conventions

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| New use case | `lib/features/<feature>/domain/usecases/<name>_use_case.dart` |
| New provider | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/providers/<name>_provider.dart` |
| New state class | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/state/<name>_state.dart` (always `@freezed`) |
| New screen | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/pages/<name>_page.dart` |
| New widget | `lib/features/<feature>/presentation/widgets/<name>_widget.dart` |
| New repository impl | `lib/features/<feature>/data/repositories/<name>_repository_impl.dart` |

State classes always include `factory <ClassName>.initial()`. Screens are `ConsumerWidget` or `ConsumerStatefulWidget`. Pure UI widgets with no providers are `StatelessWidget`.

---

## Segment Format Convention

Used in `dart_throws.segment`, `DartThrown` event payloads, and all engine logic. Never deviate.

| Hit | String |
|---|---|
| Single 20 | `'20'` |
| Double 20 | `'D20'` |
| Triple 20 | `'T20'` |
| Single bull | `'SB'` |
| Double bull | `'DB'` |
| Miss | `'MISS'` |

---

## Key Rules

**GameConfig dispatch:** Use `maybeMap` (not `maybeWhen`) — callbacks receive typed subclass instances: `config.maybeMap(x01: (c) => c.startingScore, orElse: () => '')`. Requires explicit `import 'game_config.dart'`; not available via transitive import.

**Repository exceptions:** All exceptions extend `RepositoryException` (`lib/core/error/repository_exception.dart`). Never throw raw `Exception` from a repository implementation.

**Contract tests:** Every repository implementation must pass the shared contract tests in `test/contracts/`. Never skip or comment out tests to make CI pass.

**Database:** `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` must be set in `onOpen` (sqflite) / `beforeOpen` (drift). Schema is currently single-version (`databaseVersion = 1`); future schema migrations will be applied in `onUpgrade` (sqflite) / `MigrationStrategy.onUpgrade` (drift). Completed games are read-only — enforced in application logic, not triggers.

**Dual database schemas:** The schema is declared in two parallel sources that must stay in sync: `lib/core/persistence/database_migrations.dart` (sqflite, canonical) and `lib/core/persistence/drift/database.dart` (drift web). When changing schema, update both. After editing drift table classes, run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`. The canonical SQL DDL is mirrored in `docs/DATABASE_DDL.md`.

**Drift foreign keys:** Plain `text()()` emits NO foreign key clause — you must call `.references(Type, #col, onDelete: KeyAction.{cascade|restrict|setNull})` explicitly. `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is a no-op without `.references()`. When two columns in a table reference the same parent (e.g. `game_sessions.host_player_id` and `current_turn_player_id` both → `players`), add `@ReferenceName('xxx')` annotations to disambiguate manager-API helpers, or build_runner warns.

**Test database setup:** Every sqflite-using test must call `DatabaseMigrations.createSchema(db)` and `await db.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')` before instantiating repositories — never roll a hand-crafted CREATE TABLE schema. Drift tests use `AppDatabase(NativeDatabase.memory())` directly. With FK enforcement active across both backends, fixtures must respect FK order: insert players before competitors, games before competitors/dart_throws/game_events, and use `playerRepo.createPlayer()` to seed referenced player IDs before any `createGame` call.

**Test game setup ordering:** Drift enforces read-only on completed games. In tests: create game with `isComplete: false` → insert darts/events → call `gameRepo.completeGame()`. Never set `isComplete: true` at creation if you need to insert data afterward.

**Statistics scope resets:** Turn resets on `TurnStarted`, Leg resets on `LegCompleted`, Match resets on `GameCompleted`. No other reset points.

**DartThrown payload keys:** `competitor_id`, `player_id`, `segment`, `multiplier`, `score`, `input_method` only (see `buildDartThrownEvent` in `lib/features/game/domain/usecases/game_use_case_helpers.dart`). No `turn_number`, no `dart_number` — reconstruct turn grouping via `TurnStarted`/`TurnEnded` event boundaries if needed.

**Computing stats over an event slice:** Build a `ProjectionRunner` with the projections you need, call `init(ProjectionContext(...))` then `run(events)` then `snapshot()`. Snapshot keys: `x01_average`, `x01_checkout`, `x01_highest_checkout`, `x01.highScoreBuckets`, `cricket.mpt`, `cricket.markBuckets`, `cricket.firstNineMpr`. Same wiring lives in both statistics repos and `ComputeLegStatsUseCase` — update all three when it changes. First-nine projections (`cricket.firstNineMpr`, X01 first-nine PPR) only count when `TurnStarted` events are present — fixtures emitting just `DartThrown`/`TurnEnded` silently produce null first-nine stats.

**`local_sequence` is per-game, not global:** every new game restarts `local_sequence` at 1, so multiple games' events share the same sequence range. Any query that loads events across multiple games MUST sort by `(game_id, local_sequence)` — sorting by `local_sequence` alone interleaves games and corrupts projection state across game boundaries. `ProjectionRunner.run()` enforces this internally; SQL queries feeding it should match.

**`GameStats.gameType` is load-bearing:** the post-game summary branches on `gameStats.gameType == GameType.cricket.name` to choose MPR vs PPR labels and rows. Every return path of `getGameStats` (including the empty-darts early return) must set it, in both repository implementations.

**Dual statistics repositories:** Statistics queries exist in both `lib/features/statistics/data/repositories/statistics_repository_impl.dart` (sqflite) and `lib/core/persistence/drift/repositories/statistics_repository_drift.dart` (drift). Always update both when changing query logic.

**Repository contract tests run on both backends:** `runHybridTests` (`test/hybrid_test_runner.dart`) executes a single contract suite against both sqflite and drift, with separate `setUp`/`tearDown` per engine. Add cross-backend coverage in the shared `*_contract.dart` file — the `*_drift_contract_test.dart` / `*_sqflite_contract_test.dart` wrappers are just two-liners.

**Cricket mark-bucket field overload:** `CompetitorStats.{five..nine}MarkTurns` are populated as **exact-N** counts by `getGameStats` and `ComputeLegStatsUseCase` (read from the `*Exact` snapshot keys) but as **≥-N** counts by `getPlayerStats` (read from the `*MarkTurns` keys). Same field, different cohorts by call path.

**Statistics scope is required:** `getPlayerStats` and `watchPlayerStats` take `required GameType gameType`. PPR-shaped fields are X01-only and cricket fields are cricket-only — a single call cannot mix types coherently. The player-picker AVG badge consumes `playerStatsProvider`, which passes `GameType.x01`.

**Notifier tests:** Use `ProviderContainer` with `overrides`. Never instantiate notifiers directly. Use `ProviderScope` with `overrides` for widget tests.

**Widget test finders:** `StatFormatter.fmtDouble` strips trailing zeros — e.g. `170.0` → `'170'`, which collides with raw `int` values rendered the same way. Prefer `findsNWidgets(n)` or more specific finders (`find.descendant`) over `findsOneWidget` when stat rows may share literals.

**Colors:** Always use themed color tokens from `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Never hardcode color values directly in widgets.

**Number formatting:** Use `StatFormatter` (`lib/core/utils/stat_formatter.dart`) for all statistics display — `fmtDouble`, `fmtPct`, `fmtPerLeg`. Never use inline `toStringAsFixed()` in statistics UI.

**Round semantics:** A "round" is one full rotation where ALL competitors throw. `totalRounds` is the correct field name. Do not use `maxRounds` or count per-competitor turns or individual dart throws as rounds.

**Per-leg round cap:** X01 and Cricket enforce a round cap per leg (see `GameConfigurationConstants` and engine logic). When the cap is hit with no winner, the leg is decided by current standing — do not extend rounds silently. Both engines and any UI showing round progress must respect this.

**Spec edits:** When asked to update a spec or document, only edit that document — do not modify code files unless explicitly asked.

**UI refactors:** After any widget redesign or UI refactor, update the corresponding test expectations in the same session before committing.

**Branch naming:** All work goes on a branch off `main` named `<type>/<slug>` where type ∈ {`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `hotfix`}. Slugs are short and dash-separated (`feat/cricket-stats-export`). Never commit directly to `main`.

**PR titles:** Soft Conventional Commits — `feat(cricket): ...`, `fix(x01): ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore(deps): ...`. PR titles become squash-merge commit messages and feed GitHub's auto-generated release notes.

**Squash-merge only:** PRs are always squash-merged. Don't rebase-merge or merge-commit. Branches auto-delete after merge.

**Releases are tag-driven:** Pushing a tag `vX.Y.Z` (or `vX.Y.Z-rcN` for pre-release) triggers `release.yml`, which builds and publishes the signed APK to GitHub Releases. Never manually upload an APK to a release. Tags must point to a commit that's reachable from `main` (`release.yml` enforces this). Full process in `docs/RELEASES.md`.

**Version bumps:** When asked to bump the version, edit only `pubspec.yaml`'s `version:` field (e.g. `1.0.0+0` → `1.1.0+0`) in a `chore: bump version to X.Y.Z` PR. The `+N` suffix is a placeholder; CI overrides `versionCode` from `github.run_number` on tag builds.

**CI does not run `build_runner`:** Generated `.g.dart` / `.freezed.dart` / `.mocks.dart` files are committed. After editing any `@freezed`, `@riverpod`, or `@GenerateMocks` annotation, regenerate locally and commit the result in the same PR — CI will fail otherwise.

**Analyze in CI:** `test.yml` runs `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`. Warnings block CI; infos are advisory. ~190 info-level lints are tolerated (deprecated `overrideWith`, `curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures`, `avoid_print` in test infra). Cleaning them is optional polish — never tighten this flag without raising it.

**"Unused" in `lib/` may be forgotten wiring:** When `flutter analyze` flags an unused field, parameter, or import in `lib/`, check whether it represents incomplete wiring (a setter that updates a field nothing reads, a constructor param never used in the body) before deleting. If unsure, ask — silent deletion can lock in a no-op user-facing control as the intended behavior.

## Things You Must Not Do

- Store statistics (averages, ratios, percentages) as pre-calculated values in the database
- Import `drift`, `sqflite`, `flutter`, or `dio` in any `domain/` layer file
- Import one feature's code from another feature's folder
- Call `ref.read()` inside a widget's `build()` method
- Catch exceptions inside `AsyncValue.guard()`
- Use `!` on `AsyncValue.value` in user-facing UI without loading and error handling
- Mutate `GameState` in place — always `copyWith`
- Skip or comment out contract tests to make CI pass
- Add database triggers — immutability of completed games is application logic only
- Add packages without checking whether the existing stack already covers the need
- Commit the `android/` folder — it is gitignored and scaffolded per machine via `flutter create --platforms=android .`
- Push commits directly to `main` — always go through a PR
- Tag a commit that's not on `main` (release CI refuses to build it; the only exception is hotfixes — see `docs/RELEASES.md`)
- Manually upload APKs to a GitHub Release — releases are produced by `release.yml` from tags only

---

## When Uncertain

1. **Check the spec docs first.** Most questions are answered in `docs/`.
2. **Check the game rules.** `docs/games/` has formal transition tables.
3. **Do not invent architecture.** If a pattern isn't in `docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` or `docs/ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md`, raise it before implementing.
4. **Do not change repository interface signatures** unilaterally — they are shared contracts.
5. **Raise ambiguities explicitly.** If a transition table doesn't cover a case, say so.
